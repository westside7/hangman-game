# Stickman-game
Hangman browser game
This is a random generated word letter guessing game on a browser. In this game, you will need to use letters to guess the appropriate word. You get 6 lives and each life lost is a drawn element of a stick figure. A category is provided in the beginning to help narrow down the generated word.

Edit: Due to the nature of the name, it has been renamed as Stick man game.
